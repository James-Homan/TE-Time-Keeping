# TE Time Keeping APP
L3 Harris Test Engineering Project - Time Keeping

This repository contains code for running the application. Our goals are to:

- Create a working application that can track activity time per factory.
- Make an executable out of the APP to be shared.
- 

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or download this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmdavies13/Analyzing-MLB-Pitch-Data.git
```

Open it in RStudio (or your preferred environment).

### 2. Acquire the dataset

We use the Kaggle MLB dataset (specifically the `pitches.csv` file).
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018/data

- Download `pitches.csv` from Kaggle.
- Place it in the root directory of this project.
- Note that `.gitignore` is configured to ignore `pitches.csv` so you won’t accidentally commit large data files.

## Usage

### 1. Open the Script

- The main application script is `TE Timekeeping.py`.
- You can view or modify code, run the code in a python IDE, and see results interactively.

### 2. Run the project
- This project will be designed to be a stand alone application. Simply just launch the application.
